## Course Description:

This course will introduce basic concepts and techniques in deep learning and neural networks. Topics include artificial neural networks, convolution neural networks, introduction to objective detection, few-short meta learning, etc. This is an upper-level undergraduate and graduate-level course. By the end of the course, students will be able to understand and implement simple DNN architectures using Pytorch and be ready to conduct research on these topics. Pre-requested course(s):  ICSI 311, ICSI 401 and ICSI 201. (Preferred but not required: ICSI403 and AMAT 367)
